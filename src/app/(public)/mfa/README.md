# Multi-Factor Authentication Page

## Purpose
Two-factor authentication setup and verification.

## Expected Inputs
- **Setup Mode:**
  - QR code scanning for authenticator apps
  - Backup codes generation
- **Verification Mode:**
  - `code` - 6-digit TOTP code
  - `backupCode` - Backup recovery code

## Security Considerations
- TOTP code validation
- Backup code single-use enforcement
- Rate limiting for verification attempts
- Secure secret key generation

## Next Steps
1. Implement TOTP library integration
2. QR code generation for setup
3. Backup codes generation and storage
4. Verification code validation
5. Recovery flow for lost devices
6. Integration with auth flow
7. Accessibility for screen readers
