# Step 2 Government Coverage Rollback Report

**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Task**: Rollback UI changes and maintain minimal RHF connection
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully rolled back GovernmentCoverageSection to its original UI design (Input fields for IDs, DatePicker for dates) while adding minimal React Hook Form integration. All original fields restored, no new fields added, no type conversions performed.

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED

✅ Restored original UI fields (4 inputs exactly as before)
✅ Removed all incorrectly added checkboxes (6 removed)
✅ Maintained field types (Input → Input, DatePicker → DatePicker)
✅ Added minimal useFormContext connection
✅ Preserved accessibility attributes
✅ ESLint and TypeScript compliant

---

## 2. FILES MODIFIED

| File | Changes | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `GovernmentCoverageSection.tsx` | Rollback + minimal RHF | 175 |

---

## 3. ROLLBACK DETAILS

### What Was Removed (Incorrect Changes)
```diff
- 6 Checkbox fields for government benefits:
-   financialInformation.receivesMedicaid (Checkbox)
-   financialInformation.receivesMedicare (Checkbox)
-   financialInformation.receivesSSI (Checkbox)
-   financialInformation.receivesSSDI (Checkbox)
-   financialInformation.receivesTANF (Checkbox)
-   financialInformation.receivesSNAP (Checkbox)
```

### What Was Restored (Original Fields)
```diff
+ Field 1: Medicaid ID (Input type="text")
+ Field 2: Medicaid Effective Date (DatePicker)
+ Field 3: Medicare ID (Input type="text")
+ Field 4: Social Security Number (Input type="password")
```

### What Was Added (Minimal RHF Connection)
```typescript
// New imports
import { useFormContext, Controller } from "react-hook-form"
import type { InsuranceEligibility } from "@/modules/intake/domain/schemas/insurance-eligibility"

// Form context hook
const { control, formState: { errors } } = useFormContext<Partial<InsuranceEligibility>>()

// Controller wrapper for each field (example):
<Controller
  name="governmentCoverage.medicaidId" // temporary mapping
  control={control}
  render={({ field }) => (
    <Input {...field} /* original props preserved */ />
  )}
/>
```

## 4. FIELD MAPPING STRATEGY

Since the canonical schema doesn't have direct fields for these IDs, temporary paths were used:

| UI Field | Temporary Path | Note |
|----------|----------------|------|
| Medicaid ID | `governmentCoverage.medicaidId` | Needs schema alignment |
| Medicaid Effective Date | `governmentCoverage.medicaidEffectiveDate` | Needs schema alignment |
| Medicare ID | `governmentCoverage.medicareId` | Needs schema alignment |
| SSN | `governmentCoverage.ssn` | Could map to `insuranceCoverages[].subscriberSSN` |

**Note**: These are temporary mappings. A future task should align with actual schema paths.

## 5. COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

### SoC (Separation of Concerns)
| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| No fetch/API calls | ✅ PASS | Pure UI component |
| No business logic | ✅ PASS | Only form binding |
| No schema duplication | ✅ PASS | Imports from domain |
| No infrastructure code | ✅ PASS | UI layer only |

### Accessibility (A11y)
| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Labels with htmlFor | ✅ PASS | All preserved from original |
| aria-label on inputs | ✅ PASS | Original attributes maintained |
| aria-invalid for errors | ✅ PASS | Added to all fields |
| aria-describedby | ✅ PASS | Links errors and hints |
| role="alert" for errors | ✅ PASS | Added to error messages |
| Keyboard navigation | ✅ PASS | Section header preserved |
| SSN hint preserved | ✅ PASS | "Format: XXX-XX-XXXX" |

### Tailwind Tokens
| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| CSS variables | ✅ PASS | `var(--primary)`, `var(--destructive)` |
| No hex colors | ✅ PASS | No hardcoded colors |
| Semantic classes | ✅ PASS | Standard Tailwind utilities |

---

## 6. VALIDATION STATUS

```bash
# ESLint
npx eslint GovernmentCoverageSection.tsx
✅ PASSED - No errors

# TypeScript
npm run typecheck
⚠️ Pre-existing errors in other modules (not our changes)
✅ GovernmentCoverageSection compiles without errors

# Build
✅ Dev server running without issues
```

---

## 7. COMPARISON: BEFORE vs AFTER ROLLBACK

### Before Rollback (Incorrect)
- 6 Checkbox fields for boolean benefits
- Changed UI completely
- Lost original field purposes
- No IDs or dates collection

### After Rollback (Current)
- 4 Input/DatePicker fields (exact original)
- Same UI layout and design
- Original field purposes preserved
- Minimal RHF integration added

---

## 8. RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Schema mismatch | MEDIUM | Using temporary paths until schema aligned |
| Data not persisting | LOW | Fields will save to form state |
| Validation rules | LOW | Can add Zod rules to temporary paths |

---

## 9. NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Phase 1 Continued)
1. Wire remaining sections with same pattern:
   - EligibilityRecordsSection
   - InsuranceRecordsSection
   - AuthorizationsSection

### Future (Schema Alignment)
1. Determine correct schema paths for:
   - Medicaid/Medicare IDs
   - Government coverage dates
2. Either:
   - Add fields to canonical schema, OR
   - Map to existing insurance coverage array

### Do NOT
- Change field types again
- Add new fields without explicit request
- Modify UI layout or design
- Create new components

---

## 10. LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Read requirements carefully** - "Connect to form" ≠ "Redesign UI"
2. **Preserve existing UI** - Only add minimal wiring
3. **Use temporary mappings** - When schema doesn't match UI
4. **Document sentinel comments** - Mark temporary solutions

---

## CONCLUSION

Successfully rolled back incorrect UI changes while preserving minimal RHF integration. The component now:
- ✅ Looks exactly as originally designed
- ✅ Has all 4 original fields with correct types
- ✅ Connected to React Hook Form context
- ✅ Ready for schema alignment in future task

**Time Spent**: 15 minutes
**Changes**: Restored 4 original fields, removed 6 incorrect checkboxes
**Status**: ESLint ✅ TypeScript ✅ UI Original ✅
