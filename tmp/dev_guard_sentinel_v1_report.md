## Validation GATES Implementation

### GATE 1: AUDIT SUMMARY Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure AUDIT-FIRST workflow compliance
**Validation**:
- Checks for AUDIT SUMMARY in `/tmp` directory
- Validates required sections presence
- Enforces mandatory template usage

**Reason Code**: `NO_AUDIT`

### GATE 2: Path and Alias Validation
**Purpose**: Prevent invented or non-existent import paths
**Validation**:
- Validates all `@/` imports against actual file structure
- Cross-references with TypeScript aliases
- Ensures no path guessing or assumptions

**Reason Code**: `PATH_GUESS`

### GATE 3: Duplicate Detection
**Purpose**: Prevent code duplication and promote reuse
**Validation**:
- Scans for duplicate component names
- Detects similar functionality across modules
- Enforces consolidation over duplication

**Reason Code**: `DUPLICATE_FOUND`

### GATE 4: SoC Boundary Enforcement
**Purpose**: Maintain UI→Application→Domain→Infrastructure flow
**Validation**:
- UI components cannot import from Domain or Infrastructure
- Domain layer cannot import from Infrastructure
- Enforces clean architecture principles

**Reason Code**: `SOC_VIOLATION`

### GATE 5: RLS Multi-tenant Compliance
**Purpose**: Ensure healthcare data isolation
**Validation**:
- All database queries must include organization_id
- Clinical data access requires organization boundaries
- Provider role validation for healthcare functions

**Reason Code**: `RLS_RISK`

### GATE 6: UI Token Validation
**Purpose**: Enforce semantic Tailwind v4 usage
**Validation**:
- Blocks hardcoded colors (e.g., `bg-red-500`)
- Requires semantic tokens (e.g., `bg-critical`)
- Validates OKLCH color system usage

**Reason Code**: `UI_HARDCODE`

### GATE 7: Accessibility Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
**Validation**:
- Interactive elements require ARIA labels
- Focus styles mandatory for interactive elements
- Touch targets must be ≥44px for healthcare applications

**Reason Code**: `A11Y_FAIL`

### GATE 8: Zod Schema Validation
**Purpose**: Enforce validation-first approach
**Validation**:
- Forms must use Zod with zodResolver
- API endpoints require Zod validation
- Clinical data inputs require schema validation

**Reason Code**: `NO_ZOD_SCHEMA`

### GATE 9: BFF Wrapper Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure security wrapper compliance
**Validation**:
- API endpoints require security wrappers
- Correct wrapper order: withAuth → withSecurity → withRateLimit → withAudit
- Idempotency wrappers for mutations

**Reason Code**: `WRAPPERS_MISSING`

## Reason Codes and Error Handling

### Comprehensive Reason Code System
Implemented 10 standardized reason codes that map to specific Health philosophy violations:

| Code | Healthcare Impact | Fix Required |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| `NO_AUDIT` | Bypassed safety validation | Complete AUDIT SUMMARY |
| `PATH_GUESS` | Unstable imports | Confirm all paths exist |
| `DUPLICATE_FOUND` | Technical debt | Consolidate functionality |
| `SOC_VIOLATION` | Architecture drift | Respect layer boundaries |
| `RLS_RISK` | Data breach potential | Add organization filtering |
| `UI_HARDCODE` | Inconsistent UX | Use semantic tokens |
| `A11Y_FAIL` | ADA non-compliance | Add accessibility features |
| `NO_ZOD_SCHEMA` | Data corruption risk | Implement validation |
| `WRAPPERS_MISSING` | Security vulnerability | Add BFF wrappers |
| `PROMPT_FORMAT_ERROR` | Process deviation | Follow guidelines |

### Error Reporting
**Report Generation**: `tmp/health_guard_violations.md`
**Content Includes**:
- Violation summary with counts
- Specific files and locations
- Corrective action steps
- Reference documentation links
- Reason code explanations

## Integration Testing Scenarios

### Local Development Flow
```bash
# Developer makes changes
git add .

# Pre-commit hook runs Health Guard
# ✅ Guard passes → commit proceeds
# ❌ Guard fails → commit blocked with detailed report

git commit -m "feature: add patient form"

# Pre-push hook runs Health Guard again
git push origin feature/patient-form
```

### CI/CD Flow
```yaml
# PR opened/updated → Health Guard runs
# ✅ Guard passes → PR shows green check, ready for review
# ❌ Guard fails → PR shows red X, blocks merge, comment added

# Guard generates artifact with violation report
# Team reviews violations and fixes before re-pushing
```

### Emergency Bypass Process
```bash
# Emergency only - requires approval
git commit --no-verify -m "hotfix: critical patient safety issue"

# Still validated in CI - must be fixed in follow-up PR
```

## Health Philosophy References Integration

### IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md Integration
The guard directly reads and enforces:
- **Section 2 (lines 26-41)**: SoC layer boundaries
- **Section 3 (lines 44-53)**: RLS multi-tenant requirements
- **Section 5 (lines 65-94)**: UI tokens v4 standards
- **Section 6 (lines 95-104)**: Clinical forms with Zod
- **Section 12 (lines 138-161)**: 22-point production checklist
- **Section 13 (lines 162-173)**: 15-point PR validation

### CLAUDE.md Integration
Enforces the mandatory AUDIT SUMMARY template:
- **AUDIT SUMMARY sections**: All 8 required sections validated
- **GATES system**: All gates must pass for Go decision
- **Reason codes**: Standardized error codes with descriptions
- **Health references**: Links to specific IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE sections

### SENTINEL_PRECHECKLIST.md Integration
Uses exhaustive audit protocols:
- **Directory search**: Validates against existing file structure
- **Clinical compliance**: Healthcare-specific validation requirements
- **Hard stops**: Blocks commits on critical violations

## Performance and Efficiency

### Guard Execution Time
- **Local runs**: ~2-5 seconds for typical changesets
- **CI runs**: ~30-60 seconds including setup and reporting
- **File scanning**: Optimized to only check staged files

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: Minimal - processes files sequentially
- **Disk**: Only creates report files in `/tmp`
- **Network**: No external dependencies during validation

## Security Considerations

### PHI Protection
- Guard never logs or processes actual patient data
- Only validates patterns and structure, not content
- Respects HIPAA compliance throughout validation

### Access Control
- Runs with same permissions as developer/CI system
- No elevated privileges required
- Read-only access to source files

### Audit Trail
- All guard runs logged with timestamps
- Violation reports preserved as artifacts
- CI integration provides full audit history
