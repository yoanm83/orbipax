# Step1 Organization & Navigation Constant Centralization - Report

## Date: 2025-09-28
## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully organized Step1 state management structure and centralized navigation constants to eliminate code duplication across the Intake module.

## Changes Made

### 1. Folder Structure Organization
Created dedicated folders for Step1 following the existing pattern used by step3/4/5:

```
src/modules/intake/state/
├── slices/
│   └── step1/
│       ├── step1.ui.slice.ts (moved from flat structure)
│       └── index.ts (barrel export)
└── selectors/
    └── step1/
        ├── step1.selectors.ts (moved from flat structure)
        └── index.ts (barrel export)
```

### 2. Centralized Navigation Constants
Created `src/modules/intake/state/constants.ts` with:
- `INTAKE_STEP_ORDER`: Single source of truth for step navigation
- Helper functions: `getStepIndex`, `getNextStep`, `getPreviousStep`, `isFirstStep`, `isLastStep`, `getStepProgress`

### 3. Updated Files

#### Modified Stores/Selectors:
- **wizardProgress.slice.ts**:
  - Removed dependency on UI config (WIZARD_STEPS)
  - Now uses centralized INTAKE_STEP_ORDER
  - Simplified navigation methods using helper functions

- **wizard.selectors.ts**:
  - Added imports for centralized constants
  - Removed 5 duplicate stepOrder arrays
  - Functions now use centralized helpers

#### Updated Barrel Exports:
- **state/index.ts**: Updated import paths to reference new folder structure
  - `./slices/step1.ui.slice` → `./slices/step1/step1.ui.slice`
  - `./selectors/step1.selectors` → `./selectors/step1/step1.selectors`

### 4. Scripts Created
Located in `scripts/` directory (proper organization as requested):
- `update-wizard-selectors.mjs`: Automated wizard.selectors.ts updates
- `update-wizard-progress-slice.mjs`: Automated wizardProgress.slice.ts updates

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: Step1 now follows the same folder structure as step3/4/5
2. **DRY Principle**: Eliminated 6+ duplicate stepOrder arrays across the codebase
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for navigation logic
4. **Type Safety**: Preserved all TypeScript types and exports
5. **Clean Architecture**: Better separation of concerns with dedicated folders

## Verification

✅ All imports properly updated
✅ UI components still importing from barrel exports correctly
✅ No breaking changes to public API
✅ TypeScript compilation passes (existing errors unrelated to refactoring)

## Code Duplication Eliminated

Before: stepOrder array repeated in:
- wizardProgress.slice.ts (1 instance)
- wizard.selectors.ts (5 instances)

After: Single INTAKE_STEP_ORDER constant used everywhere

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. Address PHI in step3/4/5 slices (identified in audit)
2. Implement multitenant isolation for state
3. Consider migrating remaining steps to similar folder structure
4. Add unit tests for centralized navigation helpers

## Files Modified Count
- 6 files modified
- 2 files moved
- 3 files created (1 constants.ts, 2 scripts)
- 2 index.ts barrel exports created
