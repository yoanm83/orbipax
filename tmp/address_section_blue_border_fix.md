# Address Section Blue Border Fix Report

**Date:** 2025-09-23
**Task:** Remove blue border from Address Information container on collapse/expand
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Fixed the blue border issue on Address Information section:
- ✅ Changed from `focus:` to `focus-visible:` for keyboard-only focus
- ✅ Updated to use token-based ring colors
- ✅ Focus now only appears on keyboard navigation, not on click
- ✅ Container no longer shows blue border when collapsing/expanding

---

## 1. ISSUE IDENTIFICATION

### File: `D:\ORBIPAX-PROJECT\src\modules\intake\ui\step1-demographics\components\AddressSection.tsx`

### Problem (Line 47)
The header div was using:
- `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:ring-offset-2`

This caused:
- Blue border appearing on ANY focus (including mouse clicks)
- Visual distraction when collapsing/expanding sections
- Inconsistent with other sections' behavior

---

## 2. FIX APPLIED

### Line 47 Change
```diff
- className="p-6 flex justify-between items-center cursor-pointer focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:ring-offset-2 min-h-16"
+ className="p-6 flex justify-between items-center cursor-pointer focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[var(--ring-primary)] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-[var(--ring-offset-background)] min-h-16"
```

### Improvements Made

| Aspect | Before | After | Benefit |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Focus Trigger** | `focus:` | `focus-visible:` | Only shows on keyboard |
| **Ring Color** | `ring-ring` | `ring-[var(--ring-primary)]` | Uses DS token |
| **Offset Color** | Generic | `ring-offset-[var(--ring-offset-background)]` | Token-based |
| **Outline** | `focus:outline-none` | `focus-visible:outline-none` | Cleaner focus |

---

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Focus-Visible vs Focus
- **`focus:`** - Triggers on ANY focus (mouse click, keyboard, programmatic)
- **`focus-visible:`** - Only triggers on keyboard navigation
- This prevents the blue border when clicking with mouse

### Token Usage
- `--ring-primary`: Maps to primary color (blue)
- `--ring-offset-background`: Provides proper offset color
- Consistent with other focusable elements in the system

## 4. VALIDATION RESULTS

### ESLint Check
```bash
npm run lint:eslint
```
✅ **Result:** No errors related to AddressSection

### Manual Testing on `/patients/new`

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Click on Address Information** | ✅ No blue border, section toggles |
| **Tab to Address Information** | ✅ Blue focus ring appears (keyboard) |
| **Press Enter/Space** | ✅ Section toggles, focus remains |
| **Click away** | ✅ Focus ring disappears |
| **Other sections** | ✅ No regression, consistent behavior |

---

## 5. SCOPE VERIFICATION

### Files Searched
```bash
grep "focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring"
```
**Result:** Only AddressSection had this issue

### Other Sections Checked
- ✅ Emergency Contact - No issue
- ✅ Clinical Information - No issue
- ✅ Insurance Information - No issue
- All other sections use proper focus-visible patterns

---

## CONCLUSION

✅ Blue border no longer appears on mouse click
✅ Keyboard navigation still shows proper focus ring
✅ Uses DS tokens for consistent styling
✅ No regressions in other sections
✅ Follows accessibility best practices

The Address Information section now behaves consistently with other collapsible sections, providing visual focus feedback only for keyboard users while maintaining a clean interface for mouse users.
