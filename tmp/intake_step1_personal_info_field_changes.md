## 3. DATA BINDINGS (Documentation Only - Not Modified)

The following state properties exist but were **NOT removed** from the component state interface:

```typescript
// Lines 22, 25, 36, 39 - State interface still contains:
preferredName: string;        // Line 22, 36
sexAssignedAtBirth: string;   // Line 25, 39
```

**Note:** These properties remain in the state object but are no longer rendered in the UI. A future task may clean up unused state properties if needed.

---

## 4. FIELD NUMBERING UPDATES

Updated comment labels to maintain sequential numbering after removals:

| Original | New | Field Name |
|----------|-----|------------|
| Field 1 | Field 1 | Full Legal Name |
| ~~Field 2~~ | - | ~~Preferred Name~~ (REMOVED) |
| Field 3 | Field 2 | Date of Birth |
| Field 4 | Field 3 | Gender (renamed from "Gender Identity") |
| ~~Field 5~~ | - | ~~Sex Assigned at Birth~~ (REMOVED) |
| Field 6 | Field 4 | Race |
| Field 7 | Field 5 | Ethnicity |
| Field 8 | Field 6 | Primary Language |
| Field 9 | Field 7 | Preferred Communication Method |
| Field 10 | Field 8 | Veteran Status |
| Field 11 | Field 9 | Marital Status |
| Field 12 | Field 10 | Social Security Number |

**Total fields:** Reduced from 12 to 10

---

## 5. LAYOUT VERIFICATION

### Grid Layout
- ✅ Grid structure maintained: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4`
- ✅ No empty cells or gaps in the 2-column layout
- ✅ Fields flow naturally left-to-right, top-to-bottom

### Visual Impact
- ✅ No styling changes to remaining fields
- ✅ Spacing and alignment preserved
- ✅ Form remains balanced with even field distribution

---

## 6. ACCESSIBILITY PRESERVED

### Labels & IDs
- ✅ All remaining fields maintain correct `htmlFor` and `id` pairing
- ✅ Required asterisks (*) preserved where applicable
- ✅ ARIA attributes unchanged

### Gender Field
- ID remains `genderIdentity` (unchanged for data consistency)
- Only the visible label text changed from "Gender Identity" to "Gender"
- Select options unchanged (Male, Female, Non-binary, etc.)

---

## 7. VALIDATION RESULTS

### TypeScript Compilation
```bash
npm run typecheck
```
- ✅ No new TypeScript errors introduced
- Pre-existing errors in unrelated files (appointments, notes pages)

### Runtime Verification
- ✅ Form renders correctly at `/patients/new`
- ✅ "Preferred Name or Alias" no longer visible
- ✅ "Sex Assigned at Birth" no longer visible
- ✅ "Gender" label displays correctly (without "Identity")
- ✅ Form submission would work (state handlers intact)

---

## 8. PSEUDO-DIFF SUMMARY

```diff
PersonalInfoSection.tsx:
  - Removed lines 160-170 (Preferred Name field)
  - Changed line 181: "Gender Identity" → "Gender"
  - Changed line 187: placeholder text update
