# Step 5 README Update Report
**Date:** 2025-09-26
**Type:** Documentation Creation
**Target:** Step 5 Medications & Pharmacy README

## Objective
Create comprehensive documentation for Step 5 that accurately reflects the current implementation, including both sections (Current Medications & Allergies with conditional arrays, and Pharmacy Information), architecture notes, shared utilities, and complete A11y checklist.

## File Created
`D:\ORBIPAX-PROJECT\src\modules\intake\ui\step5-medications\README.md`

**Status:** ✅ NEW FILE CREATED (README didn't exist previously)

## Content Structure Added

### 1. Overview Section
- Clear description of Step 5 purpose
- Two main sections identified
- Conditional logic documented

### 2. Sections Documentation

#### Current Medications & Allergies
```markdown
- Initial Selector: Yes/No/Unknown
- Conditional Display (when Yes):
  - Medications Array (7 fields)
  - Allergies & Reactions Array (5 fields)
- Field details with validation rules
- Required fields marked with asterisk
```

#### Pharmacy Information
```markdown
- Pharmacy Name* (name utility)
- Phone Number* (phone utility)
- Address (optional)
```

### 3. Architecture Note
```markdown
UI Layer → Application Layer → Domain Layer
├── UI: React + RHF, no business logic
├── Application: Server actions
└── Domain: Pure with Zod schemas
```

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Domain purity maintained
- UI separation enforced
- No infrastructure in UI
- Shared utilities centralized

### 4. Shared Resources

#### Validation Utilities Referenced
- **Phone utility:** `@/shared/utils/phone`
  - normalizePhoneNumber()
  - validatePhoneNumber()
  - formatPhoneInput()
- **Name utility:** `@/shared/utils/name`
  - normalizeName()
  - validateName()
  - NAME_LENGTHS

#### Shared Enum
- **SeverityLevel:** `@/modules/intake/domain/types/common`
  - Values: MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, VERY_SEVERE

### 5. Patterns & Reusability

#### Field Array Pattern
- Dynamic Add/Remove functionality
- Numbered headers (Medication 1, Allergy 1)
- Separator lines between records
- Focus management on creation
- Smooth scroll to new items

#### Button Patterns
- Add Button: Ghost variant, Plus icon, full width
- Remove Button: Ghost icon, Trash2, destructive color
- Consistent with Insurance patterns

### 6. Accessibility Checklist

#### ✅ Complete A11y Coverage
```markdown
ARIA Support:
- [x] aria-required on required fields
- [x] aria-invalid for errors
- [x] aria-describedby for error linking
- [x] aria-label on icon buttons
- [x] role="alert" on errors

Keyboard Navigation:
- [x] All controls accessible
- [x] Logical tab order
- [x] Enter/Space activation
- [x] Focus visible rings

Target Sizes:
- [x] Minimum 44×44px targets
- [x] Adequate spacing
- [x] Proper button heights
```

### 7. Additional Sections

#### State Management
- UI stores documented
- No PHI persistence noted
- Temporary state only

#### Validation
- Schema locations specified
- Rules centralized in Zod
- All constraints documented

#### Testing Considerations
- Unit test requirements
- Integration test scenarios
- A11y test checklist

#### Security & Compliance
- HIPAA compliance notes
- No PHI in storage/logs
- Secure submission only
