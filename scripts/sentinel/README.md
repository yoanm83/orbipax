# üè• OrbiPax Health Guard - Sentinel v1.1

## Overview

The Health Guard is an automated system that enforces OrbiPax Community Mental Health (CMH) development philosophy and blocks commits/PRs that violate our architectural and healthcare compliance standards.

### ‚ú® New in v1.1

- **üöÄ Fast vs Full Execution Modes**: Pre-commit runs critical gates only, pre-push/CI runs complete validation
- **üé® Tailwind v4 Allowlist**: Semantic token validation with healthcare-specific color mappings
- **üìã Declarative Manifests**: SoC and RLS rules defined in JSON configuration files
- **üìä Enhanced Reporting**: Stable reporting with mode-specific gate status
- **üîç Stricter AUDIT SUMMARY**: Content quality validation with required keywords and sections

## Philosophy Enforcement

The Health Guard validates the **AUDIT-FIRST ‚Üí APPLY** workflow and ensures compliance with:

- **SoC (Separation of Concerns)**: UI‚ÜíApplication‚ÜíDomain‚ÜíInfrastructure layer boundaries
- **RLS Multi-tenancy**: organization_id filtering and healthcare data isolation
- **HIPAA Compliance**: PHI protection and audit trail requirements
- **UI Standards**: Semantic Tailwind v4 tokens, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for all clinical data inputs/outputs
- **Security**: BFF wrapper order and idempotency patterns
- **Code Quality**: No duplicates, confirmed paths, proper TypeScript usage

## GATES and Reason Codes

### Validation GATES
The Health Guard runs 9 validation gates. **ALL must pass** for commits/PRs to proceed:

1. **AUDIT SUMMARY**: Complete audit summary with required sections
2. **PATH VALIDATION**: Confirmed imports and TypeScript aliases
3. **DUPLICATE DETECTION**: No duplicate components or functionality
4. **SOC BOUNDARIES**: Layer isolation (UI never imports Domain/Infrastructure)
5. **RLS COMPLIANCE**: organization_id filtering for clinical data
6. **UI TOKENS**: Semantic Tailwind v4 tokens, no hardcoded colors
7. **ACCESSIBILITY**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, proper ARIA labels
8. **ZOD VALIDATION**: Zod schemas for forms and API endpoints
9. **BFF WRAPPERS**: Correct security wrapper order and presence

### Reason Codes for Failures

| Code | Description | Action Required |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `NO_AUDIT` | AUDIT SUMMARY missing or incomplete | Complete AUDIT SUMMARY using template in CLAUDE.md |
| `PATH_GUESS` | Invalid import paths not in repository | Confirm all import paths exist and use proper aliases |
| `DUPLICATE_FOUND` | Duplicate functionality detected | Consolidate duplicates or create consolidation plan |
| `SOC_VIOLATION` | Layer boundary violation | Respect UI‚ÜíApp‚ÜíDomain‚ÜíInfra boundaries |
| `RLS_RISK` | Missing organization_id filtering | Add organization boundary enforcement |
| `UI_HARDCODE` | Hardcoded colors/tokens in UI | Use semantic Tailwind v4 tokens |
| `A11Y_FAIL` | Accessibility requirements not met | Add ARIA labels, focus styles, 44px targets |
| `NO_ZOD_SCHEMA` | Validation without Zod | Implement Zod schemas for validation |
| `WRAPPERS_MISSING` | BFF wrappers missing or incorrect | Add withAuth‚ÜíwithSecurity‚ÜíwithRateLimit‚ÜíwithAudit |
| `PROMPT_FORMAT_ERROR` | Prompt format not following guidelines | Follow Health philosophy prompt templates |

## Usage

### Local Development

```bash
# Run health guard in fast mode (critical gates only)
npm run health:guard

# Run health guard in full mode (all gates)
npm run health:guard:full

# Run with verbose debug output
npm run health:guard:verbose

# The guard runs automatically on:
git commit    # pre-commit hook (FAST mode)
git push      # pre-push hook (FULL mode)
```

### Execution Modes

#### ‚ö° Fast Mode (Pre-commit)
- **Gates 1, 2, 4, 6**: AUDIT SUMMARY, Path validation, SoC boundaries, UI tokens
- **Purpose**: Quick validation for immediate feedback during development
- **Duration**: ~2-5 seconds

#### üîç Full Mode (Pre-push/CI)
- **All 9 Gates**: Complete OrbiPax Health philosophy validation
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive validation before code sharing
- **Duration**: ~30-60 seconds

### CI/CD Integration

The Health Guard runs automatically on:
- **Pull Requests**: All PRs to main/develop branches
- **Push Events**: Direct pushes to main/develop branches

### Emergency Bypass

For emergency situations only (requires approval):

```bash
# Bypass pre-commit (NOT recommended)
git commit --no-verify

# Bypass pre-push (NOT recommended)
git push --no-verify
```

**Note**: Bypassing the Health Guard requires explicit approval and should only be used for critical emergency fixes.

## Report Generation

When violations are detected, the Health Guard generates a detailed report at:
```
tmp/health_guard_violations.md
```

The report includes:
- Summary of violations with reason codes
- Specific files and line numbers (where applicable)
- Corrective actions required
- References to relevant documentation

## Health Philosophy References

The Health Guard enforces the principles defined in:

1. **[IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](../../docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)**
   - Section 2: SoC Layer boundaries
   - Section 3: RLS Multi-tenant rules
   - Section 5: UI Tokens v4 requirements
   - Section 6: Clinical forms and Zod validation
   - Section 12: Production readiness checklist

2. **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)**
   - AUDIT-FIRST workflow requirements
   - AUDIT SUMMARY mandatory template
   - Reason codes and GATES system

3. **[SENTINEL_PRECHECKLIST.md](../../docs/SENTINEL_PRECHECKLIST.md)**
   - Exhaustive directory search protocols
   - Clinical compliance validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Health Guard fails with "No AUDIT SUMMARY found"**
- Create AUDIT SUMMARY using template in CLAUDE.md
- Ensure it's saved in `/tmp` directory with `.md` extension

**Path validation errors**
- Verify all imports use existing files
- Check TypeScript path aliases in tsconfig.json
- Use exact paths, no invented or assumed paths

**SoC violations detected**
- UI components should not import from `/domain` or `/infrastructure`
- Use Application layer as intermediary
- Follow UI‚ÜíApp‚ÜíDomain‚ÜíInfra flow

**RLS violations for clinical data**
- Add organization_id filtering to all clinical queries
- Implement proper multi-tenant boundaries
- Validate provider role permissions

**UI hardcode violations**
- Replace color classes like `bg-red-500` with semantic tokens like `bg-critical`
- Use Tailwind v4 design tokens defined in globals.css
- Follow OKLCH color system

### Getting Help

1. Check the violation report at `tmp/health_guard_violations.md`
2. Review the relevant documentation sections listed in the report
3. Follow the corrective actions provided
4. Run `npm run health:guard` locally to validate fixes

## v1.1 Enhanced Features

### üé® Tailwind v4 Semantic Token Allowlist

The Health Guard now validates against a comprehensive allowlist of semantic tokens:

```json
{
  "colors": ["primary", "clinical-primary", "patient-data", "emergency", "routine"],
  "spacing": ["clinical-touch", "form-spacing", "card-padding"],
  "healthcare_specific": {
    "touch_targets": { "minimum": 44 },
    "clinical_color_codes": {
      "emergency": "Critical health status requiring immediate attention",
      "patient-data": "Color coding for patient information display"
    }
  }
}
```

### üìã Declarative SoC Manifest

Layer boundaries are now defined declaratively:

```json
{
  "layers": {
    "ui": {
      "allowed_imports": ["@/modules/*/application", "@/shared/ui"],
      "forbidden_imports": ["@/modules/*/domain", "@/modules/*/infrastructure"],
      "description": "UI components can only import from Application layer"
    }
  }
}
```

### üîí RLS Manifest for Healthcare Data

Clinical data protection rules are manifest-driven:

```json
{
  "required_filters": {
    "organization_id": {
      "tables": ["patients", "appointments", "notes"],
      "enforcement_level": "strict",
      "violation_severity": "critical"
    }
  },
  "clinical_entities": ["patients", "appointments", "notes", "assessments"]
}
```

### üìä Enhanced Reporting

- **Stable Report Path**: Always generates `tmp/health_guard_violations.md`
- **Timestamped Reports**: Also creates dated reports for history
- **Mode-Specific Status**: Shows which gates ran based on execution mode
- **Configuration Status**: Shows which manifests are custom vs default

## Philosophy Commitment

The Health Guard exists to maintain the integrity of OrbiPax as a healthcare platform. Every violation it catches is a potential:
- HIPAA compliance risk
- Patient safety concern
- Clinical workflow disruption
- Maintenance and scalability issue

By following the Health Guard's requirements, we ensure that OrbiPax remains a safe, compliant, and maintainable Community Mental Health platform.
