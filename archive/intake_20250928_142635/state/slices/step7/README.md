# Step 7 - (Currently Undefined Step) UI State

## Purpose
This folder is reserved for Step 7 of the intake wizard (currently undefined/missing).

## Status
⚠️ **Step 7 is currently missing from the implementation**

Based on the wizard navigation, there should be a step between:
- Step 6: Referrals & Services
- Step 8: Treatment Goals

## Possible Implementation
This step might be intended for:
- Additional assessments
- Social determinants of health
- Support systems
- Cultural considerations

## Architecture Guidelines
- **NO PHI (Protected Health Information)** in UI state
- UI-only state: expanded sections, form validation flags, loading states
- All sensitive data must be handled in application/domain layers
- State should be resettable for multi-tenant safety

## IMPORTANT
**DO NOT MOVE EXISTING FILES IN THIS TASK**

This folder was created for organizational consistency. Implementation pending.
